Homework for the seven lesson

1.  **Task 1:**
    We created the classes “Director”, “Employee”, “Accountant”.
    We implemented the "IPositionPrint" interface with a method that defines the display behavior of the job title.
    We have implemented this method in the created classes.
    Created a runner class with a main method to run the program.

2. **Task 2:**
    We wrote a hierarchy of classes “Shape”, “Triangle”, “Rectangle”, “Circle”.
    Using an abstract class, we implemented a function for calculating area and perimeter for each type of figure.
    We created an array of 5 different shapes.
    In the runner class, we looped through the array and displayed information about each figure.
